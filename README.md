Node.js : Interpreter


 It might be helpful to think of Node as just an interpreter similar to what’s available in your browser’s developer tools. 
 Node will parse for methods that your browser will not, particularly those related to HTTP requests and responses.
 Let’s quickly explain what an interpreter actually does:
 
 -> An interpreter walks through your source code, parsing it line by line.
 -> Your source code is then translated into an intermediate representation, which is just a fancy way to say the computer is making it into something it can read more efficiently.
 -> This interpreted machine code is then run line by line.
